	<h1>Purpose, Audience & Goal</h1>
		<p><strong>Purpose: </strong>This project will be an artist portfolio showing the work and skillset of an artist applying for an in-studio concepting job for the entertainment industry.</p>
		<p><strong>Audience: </strong>This website is designed to be easily accessible and readable to potential employers both online and in person via a mobile device in order to quickly showcase portfolio pieces.</p>
		<p><strong>Goal: </strong>The primary goal of this website is to showcase different art portfolio pieces that demonstrate proficiency in the required areas for employment as a concept designer/studio artist.</p>
	<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p><strong>Name: </strong>Joe Bryan</p>
		<p><strong>Age: </strong>30</p>
		<p><strong>Profession: </strong>Currently holds a bachelors degree and is working as a teacher who is looking to make a career change. They do not have a degree in entertainment design but they have taken many online classes and have a non-traditional education background in regards to art and concept design. Joe plans on attending recruiting conventions such as CTNX and LightBox Expo in order to meet with art directors and potential employers.</p>
		<p><strong>Technology: </strong>PC power user, but proficient in Mac OSX as well as most of their time using a computer is spent in Photoshop with a 25' high definition moniter and drawing tablet. Well versed in social media such as twitter and facebook, uses an iPhone x and has an iPad Pro to take to recruiting conventions as well.</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong>Joe needs a website to show that he has an art and design skillset that is valuable to a potential employer or studio. The website needs to be able to stand on it's own with clearly labeled mediums or subject matter for portfolio work, such as environments or traditional drawing and painting. He needs a website that displays his name and contact information cleanly and clearly. The website also needs to be able to be quickly and easily communicate portfolio work on a larger mobile format such as an iPad to show potential employers in person, in real time, as well as remotely on a computer desktop or laptop. Joe's main frustration is that using a mobile device's built-in application, such as an iPad's photo application in person to an employer at a recruiting event, comes with caveats such as having the potential employer navigate through a device's software and the lack of clearly defined labels for things such as mediums or subject matter.</p>
		<p><strong>Goals: </strong>Joe is concerned with getting a job as an artist in the entertainment industry. He knows that having an online presence is important and he also understands that it is important to talk to potential employers in person. Given that in the modern day employers expect artists to work in a digital medium it is common to show portfolios in person on a mobile device such as an iPad at hiring and recruiting events. Given the limited amount of time that an employer or recruiter can spend with an individual it is important to present a portfolio quickly and efficiently to communicate that Joe would be a good candidate for said position. Should an employer be interested in looking at Joe's portfolio website again they are able to access it on their own time through a web browser as well.</p>
		<p><strong>User Story: </strong> As a user I need a website that shows my art portfolio and presents my work in the best light, both in-person on a mobile tablet, or online in a web browser.</p>
