	<h1>Purpose, Audience & Goal</h1>
		<p><strong>Purpose: </strong>This project will be an artist portfolio showing the work and skillset of an artist applying for an in-studio concepting job for the entertainment industry.</p>
		<p><strong>Audience: </strong>This website is designed to be easily accessible and readable to potential employers both online and in person via a mobile device in order to quickly showcase portfolio pieces.</p>
		<p><strong>Goal: </strong>The primary goal of this website is to showcase different art portfolio pieces that demonstrate proficiency in the required areas for employment as a concept designer/studio artist.</p>
	<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p><strong>Name: </strong>Joe Bryan</p>
		<p><strong>Age: </strong>46</p>
		<p><strong>Profession: </strong>Joe Bryan is an art director who is looking to hire new talent for a new video game studio. He is mostly looking for artists that are skilled in environments and prop design.</p>
		<p><strong>Technology: </strong>PC power user, but is proficient with smartphones and tablets of various brands such as the Microsoft Surface and iPad.</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong>In the video game industry, deadlines are tight and workers often work long hours for weeks on end, as an art director Joe looks at dozens of portfolio submissions a week, he is frustrated with poorly designed websites and a lack contact information on many portfolio sites which causes him to pass over many potentially qualified candidates. He is also frustrated with the social media aspects of modern portfolio template sites such as "likes" and follower counts that distract from the actual content of a portfolio. Joe also attends frequents in-person hiring events and conventions. His main frustration in working these events are websites that are poorly formatted for mobile and tablet devices when he is discussing a portfolio in person, either with the applicant or with his colleagues. Oftentimes, a good portfolio is passed over because of the poor implementation of a website that does not clearly label the artwork in terms of character design, environments, props, etc. that showcase a skill set that would be valuable in a studio environment.</p>
		<p><strong>Goals: </strong>Joe's goal is to be able to quickly parse whether or not the applicant is able to provide art or designs that meet the high standards for video game development at a "triple A" game studio. Joe needs to be able to make a decision quickly when looking at new applicants as the studio has very tight deadlines.</p>
		<p><strong>User Story: </strong> As a user I need to see a portfolio that is clean and organized so that I can make a better hiring decision, the website needs clear contact information and needs to be easily readable on both mobile and desktop formats..</p>
