# tdameron-pwp
Tdameron - pwp 
The pwp project for deep dive coding focusing on making an artist portfolio.

## Milestone 1 Feedback 
* Good commiting habits!
* Audience section felt more appropriate for a purpose section. Try to be more specific on the who instead of the what.
* No Attitudes and Behaviors in the Persona.
* The HTML Lang should be set to "en" instead of "eng", try to run your code through the W3C Validation Service.
* User story very clear and concise, nice.

Overall, this is a good project but could use some refinement.

**Grade: Tier III**

## Milestone 2 Feedback
* I appreciate the thought you put into the order of the sections based off of importance.
* The portfolio section will be a nice attention grabber and will draw the attention to there, so keep that in mind when styling.
* In the head you have "eng" instead of "en" for the HTML Lang again, as a final step for almost any project it is a good to run your code through the W3C Validation Service. You also don't have a closing body or html tag.
* There are some inconsistancies between the desktop and mobile wireframes such as the carousels, borders, and hr lines. Do you have a specific carousel in mind that simplifies in that way? 

Nice work, you have a good outline for your site and understand the purpose of each section. There are still some decisions to be made as far as the styling. The early turn in bumps up your grade a tier.

**Grade: Tier IV**
