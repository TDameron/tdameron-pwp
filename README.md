# tdameron-pwp
Tdameron - pwp 
The pwp project for deep dive coding focusing on making an artist portfolio.

## Milestone 1 Feedback 
* Good commiting habits!
* Audience section felt more appropriate for a purpose section. Try to be more specific on the who instead of the what.
* No Attitudes and Behaviors in the Persona.
* The HTML Lang should be set to "en" instead of "eng", try to run your code through the W3C Validation Service.
* User story very clear and concise, nice.

Overall, this is a good project but could use some refinement.

**Grade: Tier III**
